# 🎓 Student Mental Health SQL Project

This project analyzes student mental health data using SQL. It focuses on understanding the patterns of depression, anxiety, and help-seeking behavior among students based on demographic and academic factors.

## 📁 Dataset Structure

The dataset includes the following fields:

- `student_id` – Unique identifier  
- `age` – Age of the student  
- `gender` – Gender (Male/Female)  
- `course` – Student’s course  
- `year_of_study` – Academic year  
- `cgpa` – Cumulative GPA  
- `marital_status` – Marital status (Single/Married)  
- `depression` – Whether the student is depressed (Yes/No)  
- `anxiety` – Whether the student has anxiety (Yes/No)  
- `panic_attack` – Whether the student has panic attacks (Yes/No)  
- `seeking_help` – Whether the student is seeking help (Yes/No)  

## 🔍 SQL Queries Performed

- Total number of students  
- List of students with depression  
- Students who are seeking help  
- Count of depressed students by gender  
- Average CGPA of depressed students  
- Students with both anxiety and panic attacks  
- Percentage of students seeking help  
- Year-wise depression analysis  
- Mental health issues comparison by marital status  
- High CGPA students with mental health issues  

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated

- SQL table creation and data insertion  
- Filtering with `WHERE` clause  
- Aggregation with `COUNT`, `AVG`, and `SUM`  
- Conditional logic using `CASE WHEN`  
- Grouping and ordering data using `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`  

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- MySQL / DB Fiddle / SQL Workbench  
- GitHub for version control and portfolio  

## 📌 Purpose

This project is part of my data analytics portfolio and demonstrates how SQL can be used to gain insights from real-world mental health data in an academic setting.
